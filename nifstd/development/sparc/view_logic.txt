        - "Dorsal root gangla of spinal segments"
        - "Spinal cord internal structures per segment"
        - "Lamina of spinal cord"
    - "Ganglia" column put into created, top tier entity, "Peripheral Nervous System"
    NOT USED:

    - column B "Spinal cord segments" seems to be just a summary of what to come

"Parcellation Mapping for Brainstem" SHEET:
    IGNORED:
        - "Parcellation Mapping for Brainstem"."Mappings"
        - "Parcellation Mapping for Brainstem"."Nieuwenhuys"
    NAME CHANGES:
        - "Allen Mouse" -> "Allen Mouse Brainstem"
        - "Paxinos Rat" -> "Paxinos Rat Brainstem"
        - "Berman Cat" -> "Berman Cat Brainstem"
    - "Paxios Rat" has their curie split into the right adjacent column


QUESTIONS:
    - In "Spinal Cord Terminology" where should the column "Nerve roots of spinal cord segments" go?
    - The "Nieuwenhuys" was ignored, but should this be just considered 1 table to be displayed?
    - Should "Cranial Nerves" from sheet "UBERON Terms" be under "Peripheral Nervous System"?
    - Should "Nerves (also includes Cranial)" from sheet "UBERON Terms" also be under "Peripheral Nervous System"?
