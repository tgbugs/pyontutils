#hasExtrinsicPhenotype,,,,,,hasPhenotype,,
hasProjectionPhenotype,Has role,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a brain region that said neuron type sends axons to.,,"this might be clearer than hasCircuitRole but might confuse with projectsTo or the like, excitatory/inhibitory shouldn't be handled here? The way that projection vs intrinsic is modelled relates whether axons leave the brain region that contains the soma or not, this is not fully modelled at the moment",hasPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasConnectionPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a neuron type or a neuron type and a subcompartment of a neuron type some members are connected with eachother.,,Absent a specific subcompartment we can only infer hasProjectionPhenotype at the granularity of soma + dendrite location. NOTE: This relationship does not imply direction. If you need direction please choose a subproperty.,hasPhenotype,,symmetric

#hasContactWith,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a neuron type where some members make physical contact with eachother.,,"Could be makesContactWith, this is primarily for purely visual or anatomical contacts. NOTE: this is a symmetric relation unlike hasConnectionPhenotype, it can be inferred from hasConnectionPhenotype, but not the reverse.",hasProjectionPhenotype,,symmetric
hasLayerLocationPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a laminar brain region.,,"May need hasSomaLayerLocation or something, do we really even need this?? if axioms are missing in parcellation schemes and uberon then it should be easy enough to add them, or at least we won't get disjointness issues because layers of cortex are orthogonal to parts of cortex (eg) and thus we shouldnt get reasoning errors",hasLocationPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"

hasAxonPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a a neuron type and some phenotype of its axon.,,Use to provide clarity about where a generic phenotype is attached in the event that the object is not qualified.

hasExperimentalPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron and an experimental condition.
