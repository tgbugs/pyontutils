hasProjectionPhenotype,Has role,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a brain region that said neuron type sends axons to.,,"this might be clearer than hasCircuitRole but might confuse with projectsTo or the like, excitatory/inhibitory shouldn't be handled here?

hasProjectionLaterality,,,"Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and whether the target region it projects to is on the same, opposite, or both sides of the brain.",,"ispilateral, contralateral, and bilateral are kind of like cortico thalamic but they are lifted to an invariant form that doesn’t care about the exact starting side, unilateral is the union of ipsi and contra but I’m fairly certain that unilateral should never be reported because it is ambiguous, this is primarily a convenience relation for neurons that have a single projection laterality, however there are plenty of examples where there are neurons that project to two different regions one of which is ipsi and the other of which is contra, those cases require the composition to happen on the object of the restriction, so you wind up with has projection phenotype some ipsilateral region, otherwise all our definitions are consistent with bilateral and unilateral projections, which is something we will probably have to fix, right now we are using the PATO laterality terms but the modelling isn’t really what we want because we need to have ipsilateral disjoint from contralateral and disjoint from bilateral",hasProjectionPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
receivesProjectionFrom,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a brain region where said neuron type has a reverse connection phenotype with some neuron type that has its soma located in said brain region.,,"this is essentially hasReverseProjectionPhenotype, however, unlike for connection phenotypes where forward and reverse are not ambiguous, a reverse projection is a confusing concept and thus not used",hasPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
hasConnectionPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a neuron type or a neuron type and a subcompartment of a neuron type some members are connected with eachother.,,Absent a specific subcompartment we can only infer hasProjectionPhenotype at the granularity of soma + dendrite location.

hasLayerLocationPhenotype,,,Expresses a relationship between a neuron type and a laminar brain region.,,"May need hasSomaLayerLocation or something, do we really even need this?? if axioms are missing in parcellation schemes and uberon then it should be easy enough to add them, or at least we won't get disjointness issues because layers of cortex are orthogonal to parts of cortex (eg) and thus we shouldnt get reasoning errors",hasLocationPhenotype,,"asymmetric, irreflexive"
