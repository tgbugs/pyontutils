* Overview
  The Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) effort is the result of National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) drive to map out the neural circuitry responsible for visceral control in higher vertebrates. 
  
The management of multimodal anatomical knowledge is one of the mainstays of MAP-CORE’s effort in SPARC. At the core of this effort is the curation of computable and FAIR knowledge for the inferencing of multiscale parts and connectivity route pathways in support of SPARC metadata discovery.  

The SPARC Anatomy Working Group (SAWG) is responsible for the integrity of anatomical knowledge in SPARC. In particular, it provides the relevant guidance and expertise about: 

1. Defining and naming anatomical terms;
2. Maintaining ontologies of anatomical knowledge;
3. Compiling and curating computable knowledge about multiscale routes pathways.
  

This page provides access to the data generated by the SAWG which includes links to documentation about vocabulary services, term request and connectivity. This page will be continuously updated. 
  


* 1. Terminology

** 1.1 Term lists
   We have created a set of term lists of for different anatomical structures, extracted from the [[http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/UBERON][UBERON]] and [[http://fma.si.washington.edu/browser/#/][FMA ontologies]]. UBERON, a cross species anatomical ontology, is the primary source of terms, but we also draw on FMA extensively for human terms as necessary. We have the following lists available for review. If you would like the provide comments, it is easiest to provide feedback on the Google Sheet using the comment function.

** 1.2 Anatomical Terminology
   Anatomy knowledge deals with the precise relationship between a human-readable anatomical term/label and the definition of that       
   region (e.g. in the heart, community-wide consensus needs to be reached on the concept label/term “mitral valve” and the definition 
   of what it is/what its boundaries are/over which range of organisms does homology of this structure hold). In addition, the 
   identification (and, therefore, definition) of certain structures (e.g. subcellular) is dependent on a particular combination of 
   preparing/staining/imaging/image processing techniques (i.e. a protocol). The navigation of such a wide combinatorial space of 
   concepts, labels, definitions and protocols spawns a heterogeneity of approaches and, in consequence, opinions. 

   In this context, the SAWG provides community-supported leadership and arbitration on the accepted relationship between anatomical 
   label and definition (and, by extension, the relationship between concepts - i.e. between a label-definition couplet and another). 

   In addition, part of this arbitration is to recommend and reconcile different topographical atlases that capture labelled regions  
   within a coordinate system for some organ. 
   
   Another part of this arbitration is manifest via the term-request pipeline, in which a curator who has not found an appropriate label 
   with which to annotate an image sub-region can submit a new term for global use within SPARC (and beyond).

   a. Documentation for SPARC term requests
      - SPARC has several methods for adding vocabulary terms to the SPARC vocabularies, depending on the number of terms to be added.  An [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lgjvHoYJIFXYdvY9JLO5577hO3y2rnDxUd3TRmUzLXA/edit#slide=id.g5a45d9742c_0_49][overview]] of how to add to the SPARC vocabularies provides detailed instructions.
      - For internal or advanced users who are familiar with the process, you can access the  [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mU8Xxqt07pweDmtvdjDriuPSuw0EeGxiKC2733nOgvY/edit?usp=sharing][documentation sheet]] here.

* 2. Connectivity
  The development of multiscale route knowledge graphs is leveraging the ApiNATOMY knowledge representation. A graphical depiction of an ApiNATOMY model relevant to defensive breathing and Superior Cervical Ganglion physiology is shown below.
  
 [[file:https://github.com/MCSZ/pyontutils/blob/master/nifstd/resources/images/bolser-lewis_v1.png]]

  
  ApiNATOMY is used to build routing and connectivity graphs for anatomical entities. Such graphs support queries that, 
  for instance, identify neural connections that course through a tract, nerve or ganglion. ApiNATOMY-based 
  knowledge, therefore, allows the SPARC user to determine the nuclei/grey matter regions affected by the transection 
  of a nerve or the stimulation of a ganglion. In addition, the same routing information leveraged by the flatmap GUI 
  may be used to discover metadata to SPARC experimental data or simulation models that locate along the route of a 
  tract, nerve or ganglion.
